How to Play?
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player in the game. Keep the player within the boundary and try to reach to the treasure by escaping moving fireballs and campfires. Play Game.

How it Works?
In this game, you'll program key-press events to move the sprite left and right. To move the sprite left and right, use +- x width on background sprite image and similarly to move the sprite up and down, use +- height on sprite image. It will mimic the motion animation of player.
